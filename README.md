# Beyond the Anti-Jam: LLM for Zero Touch Networks

This project explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to enhance the transparency and interpretability of anti-jamming strategies in Zero Touch Networks (ZTNs). The goal is to provide human-readable explanations for DRL-based decisions, making complex strategies intuitive for network administrators. The project leverages LLMs to generate natural language descriptions for DRL actions based on observed state vectors and rewards.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch
- OpenAI Gym
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Pandas
- StreamLit

For specific library versions, please refer to the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```
3. Execute the script:

   ```bash
   python3 appy.py
   ```

### Usage

The primary script trains different DQN agent variants for a specified number of episodes. After training, the agent's performance is evaluated and plotted. Relevant data, such as agent behavior, rewards, throughput, and channel switching times, are saved for further analysis.

#### Repository Structure

The structure of the repository is designed to maintain clarity and organization:

- **agents**: This directory contains various agent implementations, categorized into different types such as actor-critic, DQN, policy gradient, and stochastic policy search agents.

- **environments**: The directory houses the implementation of the RFSpectrum environment, where the agent operates and learns.

- **results**: This directory stores the data and graphs generated during training and evaluation. The `Anti_Jam.py` script is the main entry point for running the training and evaluation process.

- **tests**: This directory can be used to write and execute tests for the codebase.

- **utilities**: The directory contains utility files, including data structures and visual assets.
